![Black and White first layer of a moon painting on 24k gold leaf gesso penal](http://moontoad.net/images/lunarem/2014-02-11-black-and-white-and-color/blackAndWhiteMoonStart-web.JPG "Moon painting started off with a simple black glaze to set the shadows of the moon.  Gesso panel with 24k gilding.")

Two different starts.

A thin black veil, upon this a second black veil will be painted and then the whites and greys of the upper layers will bring forward the face of the moon.  Elegent and minimal. 

Colors layered on top of each other, obsessivily, until a lucois black surface like that of space appears - one that you can swear you see a rainbow in.  Brilliant white on top of this to texture the moon's face into reality. 

Different starts in the road to figuring out how to paint the moon.  Both are right; many, many more variations in the process will be had for the next 350 paintings.  All are right - bringing up a tennet of this project - the variations of the same theme.  

The repetitive work of painting the same image over and over brings the  variations of the world.   I'm in the process of making a sizable number of panels - when done I will have around 100 panels ready to paint and I plan to get them all painting at the same time.  Here the variety will start to shine as I'll be able to balence the variations in color and tone for a group 3 months long.
