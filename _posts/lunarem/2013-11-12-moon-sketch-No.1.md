![Lunarem Sketch - Silverpoint 1](images/lunarem/2013-11-12-moon-sketch-No.1/Moon Sketch 1.1-web.jpg "Starting a moon sketch with silver point on panel.")

I started a couple of Moon Sketches today, the first was fished out of the panel with silver point first and then finished with oil.

Here the darks are blocked in nicely.

The second panel started straightaway with oil paint.

After a while both paintings are to the point where they must dry before I continue, that is the first layer is finished.  I think both will continue towards white and a dulling of the colors, a more monotone look all in all but these under layers will provide the pop for the final image.
