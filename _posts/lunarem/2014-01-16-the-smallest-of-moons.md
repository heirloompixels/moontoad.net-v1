![The Smallest of Moons](http://moontoad.net/images/lunarem/2014-01-16-the-smallest-of-moons/miniMoon-web.JPG alt="The smallest full moon we will see until May 18th, 2052 rising outside my bedroom windo")

The moon was full only 2 hours and 59 minutes away from it's apogee last night with this apogee being 406,536 kilometres distant making the moon almost as small as i'll see it in my lifetime.
