I loaded up the my first try at making a Penny Wood Stove with hardwood scraps and saw dust from my wood shop.  Got it packed in pretty tight to limit the air draw.

When the water boiled I look the windscreen off and let the coals burn fast, the result was very little ash:

I need to make some modifications for v2.  I've got too many holes in the bottom of the stove which makes the air draw to quickly.  In turn this causes much bigger flames and I get less of a secondary gas burn then i'd like.  I also need to lower to pot level with some smaller stakes.

Overall though I don't see much use for this in backpacking except for in places that require a stove.  The loss of the ambiance of a fire, the heat it provides and the long cook times it allows are just too important to our style of wilderness travel.  We often cook indian food - dal and roti on the trail as it is hearty, tasty, cheap and light weight but this requires a much longer cook time then any stove allows.  

I do have high hopes for this as a road trip tool though, I can just imagine the looks on peoples faces when we pull into a rest area and light up a wood stove to make coffee!
