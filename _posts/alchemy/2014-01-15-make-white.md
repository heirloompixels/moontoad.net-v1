I make my white paint every month or two.  This is titanium white, chaulk and aged, purified linseed oil.  The chaulk tones down the titanium and acts as a sicative.  The oil is flax oil I purify with the water, sand and salt method of old.  The paint is sublime.

A muller is used to grind the paint.  The action is not so much smashing as sheering the paint particles, breaking the clumps and surrounding each pigment particle in oil.

A syringe is used to hold the paint.  This is the original ready made paint tube, in the mid 1800's the first tubed paint was sold in glass syringes.  I use syringes because they are reusable and I came into a couple of boxes of them at some point.  The best part is the precise control I have over the amounts of paint I can put on the pallette.
