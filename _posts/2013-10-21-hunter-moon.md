![The Original of Lunarem]({{ site.url }}/images/lunarem/theOG/theOG.jpg)

Late Fall, the colors deep and the late light bending towards a pale fairness of a porcelin doll. Shadows deep and blue on the gold of a dying garden there is not much more food to be had from in there.  The humming birds have long since headed south: searching with their knitting stick beaks for sweeter nectar than the stale offerings at hand in this desert land. 

The rains progress is slipping away, the winds are back and the air has dried even the staunchest of mud puddles.  Our desert was paradise for a moment, a moment which hung to the sides of hillsides and bottom of arroyos with clingin, needy arms.  Give me water, give me water, give me water.  Unsciable.  A high school lust. 

Above the [Hunter's Moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_moon#Harvest_and_Hunter.27s_moons, "Wikipedia Hunter's Moon Description") hangs defiantly to the wishes of the creatures fat from a long bountiful summer.  Fruit gone the omnivores turn turn their heads towards flesh, the feast of the fall, the indulgence of protein before the cold takes root and brings brittleness back to bones.  I hear at night the haunting yips of the coyotes on the mesa opposite our house.  It's a lunarem lit affair, formal dining at it's most primitive. 

And so I start this lunar affair, cycleum lunarem.  A years worth of moons.  A preview, a pedantic attempt at rigour and routine in my daily life.  A disection of that heavenly sphere pulling at our hearts strings.
