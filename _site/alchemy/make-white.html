<p>I make my white paint every month or two. This is titanium white, chaulk and aged, purified linseed oil. The chaulk tones down the titanium and acts as a sicative. The oil is flax oil I purify with the water, sand and salt method of old. The paint is sublime.</p>

<p>A muller is used to grind the paint. The action is not so much smashing as sheering the paint particles, breaking the clumps and surrounding each pigment particle in oil.</p>

<p>A syringe is used to hold the paint. This is the original ready made paint tube, in the mid 1800&#8217;s the first tubed paint was sold in glass syringes. I use syringes because they are reusable and I came into a couple of boxes of them at some point. The best part is the precise control I have over the amounts of paint I can put on the pallette.</p>
