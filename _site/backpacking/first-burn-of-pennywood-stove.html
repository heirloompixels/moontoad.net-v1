<p>I loaded up the my first try at making a Penny Wood Stove with hardwood scraps and saw dust from my wood shop. Got it packed in pretty tight to limit the air draw. s <img alt='Title' src='images/backpacking/2013-11-05-first-burn-of-pennywood-stove/pennyWoodStove-1stTest-web.jpg' /></p>

<p>Flaming pretty good!</p>

<p>When the water boiled I look the windscreen off and let the coals burn fast, the result was very little ash:</p>

<p>I need to make some modifications for v2. I&#8217;ve got too many holes in the bottom of the stove which makes the air draw to quickly. In turn this causes much bigger flames and I get less of a secondary gas burn then i&#8217;d like. I also need to lower to pot level with some smaller stakes.</p>

<p>Overall though I don&#8217;t see much use for this in backpacking except for in places that require a stove. The loss of the ambiance of a fire, the heat it provides and the long cook times it allows are just too important to our style of wilderness travel. We often cook indian food - dal and roti on the trail as it is hearty, tasty, cheap and light weight but this requires a much longer cook time then any stove allows.</p>

<p>I do have high hopes for this as a road trip tool though, I can just imagine the looks on peoples faces when we pull into a rest area and light up a wood stove to make coffee!</p>
